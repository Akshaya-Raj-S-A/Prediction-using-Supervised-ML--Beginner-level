This is solution for my first task in The Sparks Foundation. I have used Jupyter Notebook to solve this problem in python.

Dataset used in this problem is uploaded as the csv file named "Task1_Dataset.csv". The same is also available in the link - http://bit.ly/w-data

The given problem is a simple linear regression problem with two variables as "Hours" and "Scores".

The task is to predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
